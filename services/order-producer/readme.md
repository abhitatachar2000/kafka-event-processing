## Order Producer Service

The order producer service is responsible for generating high throughput orders data. 
The events generated by this service is added to a topic called `orders.raw`.


#### What This Service Does

1. Generates mock order events
2. Publishes them to Kafka
3. Controls rate & volume

#### What It Does NOT Do

1. Validate orders
2. Check inventory
3. Handle failures

The service can be started by executing:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The service runs on port 8005.

To trigger the generation of order events we need a POST call needs to be made to the `/api/v1/orders/generate` and it expects two query parameters `?rate` and `?duration`. Following is an example of the post call:
```bash
 curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/api/v1/orders/generate?rate=1000&duration=10"
```
