## Order Producer Service

The order producer service is responsible for generating high throughput orders data. 
The events generated by this service is added to a topic called `orders.raw`.

The topic was created with 6 partitions and replication-factor of 1 (since we have only one broker). You can find the topic creation configuration [here](https://github.com/abhitatachar2000/kafka-event-processing/blob/b4b7cbb16d8b1e25523de2c0395ede954b679a34/docs/topics.md?plain=1#L5-L12).


#### What This Service Does

1. Generates mock order events
2. Publishes them to Kafka
3. Controls rate & volume

#### What It Does NOT Do

1. Validate orders
2. Check inventory
3. Handle failures

### Learning:

The use of keys ensures that all events with the same key falls to the same partition. When the key was included as a part of the payload set to the Kafka broker, the event was added to the same partition. When the key was not used, based on Kafka's discretion, the event was added to one of the partition. 

The service can be started by executing:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The service runs on port 8005.

To trigger the generation of order events we need a POST call needs to be made to the `/api/v1/orders/generate` and it expects two query parameters `?rate` and `?duration`. Following is an example of the post call:
```bash
 curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/api/v1/orders/generate?rate=1000&duration=10"
```
